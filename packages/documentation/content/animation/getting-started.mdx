Easily add CSS animation to your react styled components via custom
[hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html).

> All the animations are created with
> [CSS Animations && @keyframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation)

## Installation

You can install `@frigobar/animation` using either of the methods below.

For npm users:

```shell
npm install @frigobar/animation --save
```

For Yarn users:

```shell
yarn add @frigobar/animation
```

An important note is that the **styled-components** is a peerDependency
[see why](https://styled-components.com/docs/faqs#i-am-a-library-author-should-i-bundle-styledcomponents-with-my-library), if
you dont have styled-components installed you'll
[need to install](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation).

## Usage

You can simply import the desired animation from the package and use it in any
component.

It's highly recommended to install the [babel-plugin](https://github.com/frigobar/frigobar/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin)
to use the `animation` prop to apply your animations.

Example:

```jsx
import { useFade } from '@frigobar/animation';

const App = () => {
  const [{ animation }] = useFade();

  return <div animation={animation}>fade</div>;
};
```

Example without `animation` prop:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { useFade } from '@frigobar/animation';

const Div = styled.div`
  animation: ${props => props.myAnimation};
`;

const Button = props => {
  const [{ animation }] = useFade({
    startOnRender: true,
  });

  return (
    <>
      <button
        {...props}
        css={`
          animation: ${animation};
        `}
      />

      <Div myAnimation={animation}>animation</Div>
    </>
  );
};

export default Button;
```
